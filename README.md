# Student Growth Analysis - Understanding Academic Progress and the Impact of COVID-19

## Introduction

The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into student growth over time and identify demographic groups that performed better than others. Additionally, we aim to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic had any discernible impact on student growth. Understanding these trends is crucial as students continue their academic journey in the post-pandemic era. 

This README provides information about Student Measures of Academic Proactice (MAP) Data Analysis, a project designed to analyze student progress from Kindgergarten (2016) to Sixth Grade (2023). 

## Data Source

This dataset was sourced from a local school district. To safeguard the privacy of individuals involved, we've replaced all names, including those of students and teachers. The dataset comprises information on 244 sixth-grade students, with data spanning from 2016 to 2023, representing various points in their educational journeys.

+ In accordance with ethical considerations, we have taken every precaution to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of individuals involved in this project. All student names have been changed, and no identifying information has been included to reveal students' identities. Any data or information related to students used in this project has been anonymized or fictionalized to ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed. 

## Data Preparation

The dataset underwent preprocessing through PostgreSQL to merge and compile a larger table containing student demographics and their corresponding academic scores. To enhance data analysis clarity, columns have been thoughtfully renamed. Additional analysis is being carried out through a Jupyter Notebook. 

## Academic Milestones

To benchmark academic performance, we consider specific score thresholds as "on-grade level" for each academic year. The following scores would be considered on-grade level for each Beginning of Year (BOY) test:

- BOY Kindergarten: 135
- First Grade: 155
- Second Grade: 170
- Third Grade: 184
- Fourth Grade: 196
- Fifth Grade: 199
- Sixth Grade: 205

However, it's essential to note that these values do not account for the educational disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Questions Addressed

- Are students demonstrating continuous academic growth over time?
- Did the COVID-19 pandemic have a measurable impact on student growth?
- Which group of students exhibited the most significant academic growth, including Emergent Bilinguals (EBs), Special Education (SpEd) students, or Honors students?

## Results

The analysis revealed several key findings:
- Most students showed continuous academic growth from 2016 to 2023, with variations in growth rates.
- The influence of specific teachers on student performance was evident, particularly among honors students.
- Disruptions caused by the Spring 2020 COVID-19 shutdowns were reflected in reduced student participation in MAP testing.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The main takeaway from this analysis is the importance of continuous student growth. Future work for this project includes the development of an interactive dashboard, allowing for more granular analysis at the individual student level rather than only at the teacher level.
